**Introduction**

This is a simple command-line-based employee management system built using core Java classes and file handling for data storage. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee information. It also includes data validation and search functionality.

**Features**

The Employee Management System provides the following features:

Create Employee: Users can create a new employee by providing the necessary details such as name, age, designation, and salary. The system will validate the input data before adding the employee.

Add Employee: Users can add an existing employee to the system by providing the employee details. The system will validate the input data before adding the employee.

Read Employee: Users can view the details of all employees in the system. The system will display the employee ID, name, age, designation, and salary.

Update Employee: Users can update the details of an existing employee by providing the employee ID. They can modify any of the employee's information, such as name, age, designation, or salary. The system will validate the input data before updating the employee.

Remove Employee: Users can remove an employee from the system by providing the employee ID. The system will prompt for confirmation before deleting the employee.

Search Employee: Users can search for an employee by name. The system will display a list of employees whose names match the search query.

Clear Employee Data: Users can clear all employee data from the system. The system will prompt for confirmation before clearing the data.
**Usage**

Upon running the application, you will be presented with a menu of options. Use the corresponding numbers to select an action:

Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the desired action. For example, when creating an employee, you will be asked to enter the employee's details.
